Platform for measuring data on a bicycle and collecting it.
Currently, we measure the distance with either HC-SR04 or JSN-SR04T 
ultrasonic sensors connected to an ESP32.


## Description

Inspired by the Berlin project Radmesser. This version uses a simple push 
button at the handle bar to confirm distance-measures were actually overtaking 
vehicles. It has its own GPS, and a SD card for logging, so it does not 
require any additional hardware (like a smartphone).

Starting with version v0.3 the firmware also exposes the measured data via 
[BLE bluetooth](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensorFirmware/blob/master/docs/software/firmware/bluetooth_services.md).
You can use this to feed data to the
[SimRa](https://www.mcc.tu-berlin.de/menue/forschung/projekte/simra/) App or
any other app collecting heart-rate BLE data. 


## Updating

### Step By Step version v0.7.x ff

1. Check if the Flash App is already installed. Go to _Update Flash App_ 
   if no, or an outdated version is installed, push _Update to vX.Y.ZZZ_. 
   The latest version of the "Flash App" gets then installed directly 
   from GitHub, and you are redirected to the _Update firmware_ page. 
   You might need to look twice - the _Update firmware_ page looks 
   similar to the _Update Flash App_ page.
   
1. On _Update Firmware_ push "Update to vX.Y.ZZZ". The
   version is downloaded directly to your OBS device from GitHub.
   After the Download the device reboots and does some housekeeping
   so be patient within one or two minutes the device boots up
   with the new version.

### Details

The update mechanism consists of 2 parts. A small firmware called Flash App
is used to read the new firmware from the SD card and flash it to the obs.

So as a 1st step you need to make sure that the Flash App part is installed
on you ESP, you can do so by using "Update Flash App" button and start the 
update b pressing "Update to vX.Y.ZZZ". The data is directly downloaded from
GitHub, so the ESP needs to have access to the internet via your WiFi. You
can also download the `flash.bin` directly from the 
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensorFlash/releases) 
page. The direct update from GitHub has currently no progress bar so be
patient.

Now you need to download the OBS Firmware and place it as `/sdflash/app.bin`
on the SD Card. This is also fully automated behind the "Update Firmware"
button, There you can again directly download the latest version and start
the internal update process with the "Update to vX.Y.ZZZ" button. Make sure 
it is a version newer v0.6.x. At the time of writing there is no such version 
released yet. Do not downgrade to a version prior v0.6.x, once the Flash App 
was installed. A hint on the "Update Firmware" page will show the version of
the Flash App you have installed or if the Flash App is not installed hint 
you to install the Flash App 1st. With the "File Upload" option you can 
also update to locally built versions. Make sure they are pos v0.6 versions!
The 1st update includes a repartitioning of the ESPs flash where you
do not see any indication of progress. Be patient all does not take more
than one or two minutes after the upload was completed.

The About page gives you some insight of the current partitioning a more 
detailed documentation will come. 

### from v0.6.x, changing the partition schema

The version v0.6.x is the version that introduced the new partitioning 
schema. This version is small enough to run in the old schema but also 
brings the needed logic to migrate to the new schema. 

To trigger the migration do the following steps. 

1. make sure you have a recent v0.6.x, currently v0.6.556
1. make sure you have the recent Flash App (v0.1.22) installed. You can
   install this version directly in the OBS UI "Update Flash App" -> 
   "Update to v0.1.x".
1. to trigger the repartitioning, install the v0.6.x again, 
   via OBS UI "Update Firmware", either via "Update to v0.6.x"
   or if no v0.6.x is offered via "File Upload". Make sure to use 
   a v.0.6.x version. Older versions will not be able to handle 
   the new update mechanism and newer versions do not fit
   in the old partitioning. This will take a bit longer than
   a usual reboot, one or two minutes.
1. with the reboot now the partitioning is changed, and you can
   start installing v0.7.x ff. You can also observe this
   by looking at the about page. Check _OTA-0 Partition Size:_ 
   this should be around 3.5mb it holds the OBS firmware, and
   _OTA-1 Partition Size:_ which is only 256kb and holds the 
   small Flash App thai is now responsible for the update of 
   the OBS firmware from data stored on the SD Card.


### from v0.5.x or earlier

With version v0.6 a new update path was introduced. To allow updating, 
to versions of v0.6 or newer you at least have to have version v0.6 installed.

The update process is as usual, download the latest v0.6.x from GitHub
and use the "Update Firmware" functionality in server mode. See above 
for the next steps. 

### from v0.2.x or earlier

update functionality. For the 1st flashing of the firmware or the update
from a version prior v0.3.x you have to plug in USB.
See [flash documentation](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensorFirmware/blob/master/docs/software/firmware/initial_flash.md)   
for a documentation how to do a manual flash it if you do not want to 
set up an IDE as described below.


## Find the documentation

You can find the OpenBikeSensor documentation under:
* [openbikesensor.org](https://www.openbikesensor.org/)


## Getting Started

1. You need a OpenBikeSensor in order to try work on the Firmware. [Head over to our Hardware Guide to assemble one](https://www.openbikesensor.org/hardware/).
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensorFirmware.git` and `cd` into it.
3. Choose between developing with recommended [VSCode](https://www.openbikesensor.org/software/firmware/setup.html#vscode), 
   or [CLion](https://www.openbikesensor.org/software/firmware/setup.html#clion) (license required), 
   respectively [Arduino IDE](https://www.openbikesensor.org/software/firmware/setup.html#clion) (discouraged).
4. Happy Coding! :tada: We are open for your pull request.
