// Use custom_config.ini to set the needed variant!
// If set, the firmware is build for the OBSPro hardware variant
// The main differences are:
//   - The button is inverted
//   - The button is also responsible for soft-power-off
//   - The display is a JHD12864-G156BT which is SPI based
//   - The ultrasonic sensors are PGA460 based
